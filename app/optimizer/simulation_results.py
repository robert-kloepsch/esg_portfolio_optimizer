    '''
    The tool connects to a db, gets the data, simulates the number of simulations, calculates the result for each dimension and returns the best possible allocation (weights) 
    of the isins depending on the user defined weights (importance of each dimension)
    It also sends the results back into a db

    Args:
        number_of_simulations (int): 
            Defines how many simulations are performed
        token (str): 
            Verifies the user
        keep_strategy (int): 
            Defines, if user wants to keep the strategy in his portfolio (0=no, 1=yes)
        strategy_list (dict):
            Exactly tell the program a desired outcome. The user needs to give a range for each constraint dimension as a list with to integers.x
            If strategy list is empty, the strategy of the given portfolio will be taken and kept for optimization.

    Returns:
        weights_and_isins (dict):
            Combines the optimal isins and its corresponding weights -> Gives an overview on what percentage of each isin is reccommended to get the best result
        optimized_values (list):
            Shows the optimal result for each dimension such as return or risk etc.
        coverage (float):
            Percentage of covered isins in our db compared to the users input list
        not_covered (list):
            List of isin that have been provided by the user but are not covered in our db
